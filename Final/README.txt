In my final project, I create the 3 more calculator function for my calculator.
When you compile the project, you will see the menu that told you about what program that provided to you to calculate what you need.

The Functions(buttons) include
1. Getting your basic mathmatics calculation done:
   It includes +,-,*,/. Also, it has the function to examine if the first number is greater, smaller, equal,not equal to the second number.

2. GCD/LCDbutton:
   You are able to calculate the GCD(greatest common divisor) and LCD(least common denominator).

3. Prime checker:
   For this one, you are able to input the number you want, and the calculator will check if the number is prime or not.

4. Fibonacci sequence:
   For this one, you are able to input the length you want for the display fibonacci sequence. Then the calculator will return the all fibonacci sequence for you

In the program, each sub-form. I did not include the confirm to quit for the user, I think it is unnecessary to construct the confirm quit for the sub-form.
However, I include the confirm quit and give the user warning for the main form. Since it will warn the user about really want to close the program ot not.

I also create the window size to fit well for all the program for each sub-form.
