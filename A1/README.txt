Properties that I changed for the A1 programming homework.

1. I change the picture box from single line to Fix3D.. Because I think sicne you want people add the picture, most of the time, the box usually in 3D like.

2. I change the form ICON from the default to the camera picture icon. You have to use .ico file. Since everything that I downloaded from website, I have to convert it to 
   the .ico file.

3. In the X and Y label, I decide to start with the "X = NA" "Y = N/A" lable in the window because user will know that the program will track your mouse position. 
   When the mouse pointer leaves the picture box, I will print the "X = N/A" "Y = N/A" instead of just disappear 
   because I think that user will know that the pointer is not in the picture box.

4. For the select picture, I change the Anchor to be bottom left since I put my select picture button on the buttom left

5. I also change the background color to green. Most of the time, select will be green.

6. For the Quit, I change the Anchor to be bottom left since I put my Quit button on the buttom left

7. I also change the background color to red because most of the time, Quit will be red.

8. For the Draw Border, I change the Anchor to be bottom left since I put my select picture button on the buttom left

9. I draw the border with Coral

10. I change all the text font to Bold because I think it will provide the good visual for the user

11. I change the shrink and enlarge by only + and - 10; I think + and - 20 is a little too big for me
