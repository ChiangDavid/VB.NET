For my calculator, the goal for my design is that user will get a notice(log) if user divide the 0 (when the second number that user input is 0).
I have different approach to the calculator than the one we did in the class. 
I think if I design my calculator as horizontal, I am able to large the buttons, so that the user will see each operation clearly.
 Since most of the quit and clear buttons are at the top right. 

Also, most time when you/users see the calculator, most of the time, input numbers and result are at the top of the program. 
I think this design is much more user friendly.

I also create the error message for the Quit button and divide by 0 error or 0 divide by 0.

When the user press the Quit, it will show the message that warn the user if he or she really wants to quit the calculator program.
Also, when the user input the 0 into the number 2 (divide by 0 error), After he or she pressing the divide operation. 
It will give the user error message, and show “ERROR” in the Result box. 
So the user will know the result is 0. 

However, I didn’t give the user error message about the user input is a non-number. 
I think once the user knows that the program is the calculator, he or she will only input the numbers. 


Since my final project is more complex calculator but include the this calculator. So this design (basic calculator) will be added into one of my few little calculator program.
